# Snowflakes Ornaments

A simple project: easy to print and support‑free.

## Design Process

### Illustration

The first step started with external inspiration, a pen, paper, and music. After drafting the initial sketches, the artwork was vectorized in Adobe Illustrator and exported as a DXF file.

### 3D Modeling

With the DXF prepared, the modeling process in Fusion 360 was straightforward. Extruding the individual elements took approximately 30 minutes.

### 3D Printing

This stage required additional tuning since printer settings were not fully optimized, resulting in some warping on early attempts. After adjustments and adding a small brim, the print came out perfectly: quick, clean, and entirely supportless.
