Snow flakes ornaments

a simple proyect, an easy print and without supports!!


Design proces:

Illustration; this being the first step, with some insipration from outside, a pen, paper and music, the initla sketches were doone, sou after the sketch I hopped into illustrator vectorizing this images and later exporting them as an dxf

3d Modeling: With the dxf done, it was just light work to hop into fusion 360 and extrude the little pieces, taking me just 30 minutes.

3d print: This took a bit more time since i dont the setting dialed in for my 3d printer, so i had a bit of warping, but nowwww HOLY the print was perfect, the little brim I added make it perfect, no issues, so fast and most importanly supportless
